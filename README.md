# DSP Project for increasing bass of a song.
This project allows users to process a song from Spotify in real-time using a digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm written in C++ to increase the bass of the song. The user can specify the song and the DSP algorithm will be applied automatically. The processed song will be streamed in real-time to a web browser. The project uses the Spotify Web API to retrieve the audio data for the specified song and the C++ program to apply the DSP algorithm and stream the processed audio data. The program is designed to run until the song stream ends.
